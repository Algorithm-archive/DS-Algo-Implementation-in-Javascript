# Linear Search

**Linear search** is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

#### Python Implementation

Though it is very easy in python to check for [an item's existence in a list](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7571665/4230330) by:

`item in list`

and [finding an item's index](http://stackoverflow.com/a/176921/4230330) by:

`list.index(item)`

but sometimes you might need to do some customization on the searching algorithm. Like- *'finding the last occurrence of the item in the list'* etc. This linear search implementation will help you to do that.

#### Complexity Analysis
- Worst Case - O(n)
- Best Case - O(1)
- Average Case - O(n)
