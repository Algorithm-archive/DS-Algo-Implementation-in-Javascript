# Factorial

In mathematics, the **factorial** of a non-negative integer n, denoted by **n!**, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example:

```
 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    = 120
```

We can easily calculate a factorial from the previous one:

So, the rule is:
```
n! = n × (n−1)!
```
> The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an [empty product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_product).

Factorials are used in many areas of mathematics, but particularly in Combinations and Permutations.
