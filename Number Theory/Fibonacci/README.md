# Fibonacci

The **Fibonacci Sequence** is the series of numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

In this sequence, every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

The sequence **F<sub>n</sub>** of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the [recurrence relation](Recurrence_relation) :

**F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>**

with seed values :

**F<sub>1</sub> = 1 and F<sub>2</sub> = 1**

or

**F<sub>0</sub> = 0 and F<sub>1</sub> = 1**
