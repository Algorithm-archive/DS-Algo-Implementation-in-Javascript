# Least Common Multiple(LCM) Finding

The **least common multiple**, **lowest common multiple**, or **smallest common multiple** of two integers a and b, usually denoted by **LCM(a, b)**, is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b.

#### Computing the Least Common Multiple:

The following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:

```
lcm(a,b) = (a * b)/gcd(a,b)
```
