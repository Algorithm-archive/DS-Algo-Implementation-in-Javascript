# Introduction

**You need to have basic understanding of the Javascript programming language to proceed with the codes from this repository.**

---

JavaScript is a **loosely typed** or a **dynamic language**. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time. The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. That also means that you can have the same variable as different types:
```javascript
var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean
```

### Data Types in Javascript
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

- Six data types that are primitives:

  - Boolean (`true` and `false`)
  - Null (invalid object or address has the value `null`)
  - Undefined (a variable that has not been assigned a value has the value `undefined`)
  - Number (integer and floating point values ranging from  -(2<sup>53</sup> -1) to (2<sup>53</sup> -1), +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN(not-a-number) )
  - String (Sequence of textual characters. Strings are immutable in Javascript)
  - [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) (new in ECMAScript 6)

and
- [Object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp)

#### Arrays
Javascript **Arrays** are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-key-ed properties and the 'length' property. Additionally, arrays inherit from Array.prototype which provides to them a handful of convenient methods to manipulate arrays like indexOf (searching a value in the array) or push (adding an element to the array), etc. This makes arrays a perfect candidate to represent lists or sets.

### How to Use
The easiest way to run and test the codes from this repository is to use [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Install it in your machine and add it to your environment path so that it is accessible in terminal commands.

Then you can run a Javascript file like this:
```javascript
node file.js
```
